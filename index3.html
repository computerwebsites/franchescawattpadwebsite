				<h1>Hawk</h1>
				<p>Kas Balera is used to a bit of chaos.

As a space bounty hunter, capturing three Class-2 criminals should have been the most difficult part of her week, but when a disaster of epic proportions rocks the entire solar system, Kas is thrust into the midst of an adventure far beyond her wildest fantasies.

With the help of a federal robot, a child genius, and her trusty ship - the Calista - Kas must use all her quick thinking and sharp wit if she's going to stay alive and uncover the new dark and dangerous mysteries of the galaxy.

Pursued by evil X1 robots, bio-mech panthers and astral police officers, even Kas's kick-ass fight training and expert piloting can't seem to stop the entire galaxy from going after her.</p>

				<h1>The Dragon Chase : Tale of Everburning City</h1>
				<p>There is no night in the Everburning City. 

There can never be. 

For four hundred years, the City has been besieged by an enemy that has swallowed the entire world. The land that the City now sits upon has been claimed from the Gloam; a grey mass of smoke-like mist that kills everything within it. Only fire, pumped endlessly from beneath the world, holds the Gloam at bay.

But things move beneath the shrouding mists of the Gloam, and they march for the City. Against them lie only the resolve of its soldiers, and the audacity of Crafter Tabitha a'Loria, and her apprentice Gerald Raeth, defying the powers of the City to build the first hope humanity has known since the Everburning City's founding.</p>

				<h1>The Frozen Throne</h1>
				<p>Their family murdered; their fortress obliterated; the jarlheim thrown into chaos. In one moment, the lives of Baeorn and Aelthena are upended, and brother and sister must fight to keep the Frozen Throne.

Baeorn, suddenly become the heir to the throne, inherits responsibilities he never dreamed of having. But Baeorn hungers for revenge, if he can manage to overcome his own cowardice.

Aelthena, who has dreamed of ruling all her life, sees that her moment has come. But even if her brother yields the throne, she must combat a host of other claimants to power if she's to achieve her dream.

Little do they know, but their struggles are only just the beginning. A powerful, dangerous substance has slowly seeped out into the world, and is on the verge of outpouring. And with its coming, a legend will awake.</p>
